# Operating System Programs

This repository contains a collection of programs related to various operating system concepts and algorithms. Each program demonstrates a specific concept or scheduling algorithm used in operating systems.

## List of Programs

1. **Fork System Call**
   - Demonstrates the usage of the `fork()` system call to create child processes in a Unix-like operating system.

2. **First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling**
   - Implements the FCFS scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order of their arrival.

3. **Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling**
   - Implements the SJF scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest burst time is executed next.

4. **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) Scheduling**
   - Implements the SRT scheduling algorithm, a preemptive version of SJF where the process with the shortest remaining burst time is executed next.

5. **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**
   - Implements the non-preemptive priority scheduling algorithm where processes are scheduled based on their priority.

6. **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**
   - Implements the preemptive priority scheduling algorithm where the currently executing process can be preempted by a higher-priority process.

7. **Round Robin Scheduling**
   - Implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm where each process is given a fixed time quantum in a cyclic order.

8. **Banker's Algorithm**
   - Demonstrates the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance by allocating resources in a safe sequence.

9. **Producer-Consumer Problem**
   - Solves the producer-consumer problem using semaphores or mutexes to manage synchronization between producer and consumer processes.

10. **Dining Philosopher Problem**
    - Solves the dining philosopher problem using semaphores or mutexes to avoid deadlock and ensure synchronization among philosophers.

11. **Process Scheduling**
    - Demonstrates various process scheduling algorithms and their implementation.

12. **Page Replacement Algorithms**
    - Implements different page replacement algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, Optimal, etc., to manage memory.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you will need a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and a Unix-like operating system. Follow the instructions below to compile and run each program.

### Compilation

For example, to compile the FCFS scheduling program:
```sh
gcc -o fcfs fcfs.c
```

### Execution

To run the compiled program:
```sh
./fcfs
```

Repeat the above steps for other programs by replacing `fcfs.c` with the corresponding source file.
