###Operating System Programs Web Page
Welcome to the Operating System Programs web page! This page contains the implementation and explanation of various operating system algorithms and concepts. Each section provides code snippets and descriptions to help you understand how these algorithms work.

## List of Programs

1. **Fork System Call**
   - Demonstrates the usage of the `fork()` system call to create child processes in a Unix-like operating system.

2. **First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling**
   - Implements the FCFS scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order of their arrival.

3. **Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling**
   - Implements the SJF scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest burst time is executed next.

4. **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) Scheduling**
   - Implements the SRT scheduling algorithm, a preemptive version of SJF where the process with the shortest remaining burst time is executed next.

5. **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**
   - Implements the non-preemptive priority scheduling algorithm where processes are scheduled based on their priority.

6. **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**
   - Implements the preemptive priority scheduling algorithm where the currently executing process can be preempted by a higher-priority process.

7. **Round Robin Scheduling**
   - Implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm where each process is given a fixed time quantum in a cyclic order.

8. **Banker's Algorithm**
   - Demonstrates the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance by allocating resources in a safe sequence.

9. **Producer-Consumer Problem**
   - Solves the producer-consumer problem using semaphores or mutexes to manage synchronization between producer and consumer processes.

10. **Dining Philosopher Problem**
    - Solves the dining philosopher problem using semaphores or mutexes to avoid deadlock and ensure synchronization among philosophers.

11. **Process Scheduling**
    - Demonstrates various process scheduling algorithms and their implementation.

12. **Page Replacement Algorithms**
    - Implements different page replacement algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, Optimal, etc., to manage memory.

## Getting Started
To access the web page, open the index.html file in your web browser. Each section of the web page contains a description and code snippets for the corresponding operating system program.

**File Structure:**

index.html: The main HTML file that structures the content of the web page.
styles.css: The CSS file that styles the web page.

script.js: The JavaScript file (if needed) for any interactive functionality.

Viewing the Web Page
To view the web page, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You can navigate through the different sections to explore the various operating system programs and their code implementations.

To run these programs, you will need a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and a Unix-like operating system. Follow the instructions below to compile and run each program.

### Compilation

For example, to compile the FCFS scheduling program:
```sh
gcc -o fcfs fcfs.c
```

### Execution

To run the compiled program:
```sh
./fcfs
```

Repeat the above steps for other programs by replacing `fcfs.c` with the corresponding source file.
